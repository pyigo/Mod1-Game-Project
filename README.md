This a class project to apply HTML,CSS,JS to build a game
This assignment has helped me understand functions and the DOM manipulation. 
I encountered difficulties while trying to get input username value from home page to game page
I also did not know how to stop the game from continuing after the user lost after three wrong questions
original plan was also to have three rounds that I did not know how to implement, and a timer
(Answer choice can only respond to click on text, not prefix and not the container)
************IMPROVEMENTS**************
Create rounds
make game stop after player has lost
