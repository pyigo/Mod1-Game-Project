# Mod1-Game-Project
This a class project to apply HTML,CSS,JS to build a game
I am learning how to use Bootstrap
trying to figure out how to make changes to my website while using css pages and bootstrap completely broke my code tonight
I cloned another repository mistakenly
now I cant commit anything to my repo, I get "your branch is uptodate"
